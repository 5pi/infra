# 5pi.de Infrastructure
*A kubernetes based small scale infrastructure.*

This root directory contains scripts and configuration which is used both by
[packer](/packer) and [terraform](/tf).

## State and Goals
This is work in progress. It might be useful as reference but can't be used to
create your own infrastructure... yet. But that's the goal.
